title: 3D Printing an under-desk MacBook mount
date: 2023-07-01

## Intro

I wanted to a) make more room on my desk and b) make it easier for me to plug my MacBook into its hub. The obvious idea was to create a mount that will screw into the underside of my desk and allow me to slide my MacBook in. 

## BOM

- PETG for strength and heat resistance (used PoltLite, not great, see “Learnings”)
- 4x #8 3/4 inch screws
- White adhesive-backed felt

### CalDigit Mount

It turned out that the Thunderbolt that went from my hub to the MacBook is too short to reach the front of my desk. A longer one costs $60+, so I figured rather than getting a longer cable I’ll just move the hub closer to the MacBook by mounting it under the desk too.

### Learnings

1. Always look for inspiration on Printables before printing your project
    1. In my case, I could have saved a lot of filament and printing time by taking inspiration from other desk mounts
2. PolyLite PETG prints terribly for my (some 2 year old random brand, 3D Warhorse, from Amazon printed way better), so satay away from that
3. Triple checking measurements was good, but also double check that your tools can for when you need to assemble

## Challenges

I really wanted to make more content out of this but I was strapped for time, which was made even harder as I had other side projects that I wanted to complete as family/friends to spend time with. 

All in all it’s made me really happy to get this done and have something useful, but I can’t help but feel that I wish I captured more of the experience to share with people. It just that if I was coming up with a story, working our filming angles and setting up tripods etc. when I did really know what I was doing with the print anyway, I may have never have got this done.
