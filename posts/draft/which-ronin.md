# DJI RS3 vs RS3 Pro - which one should a prosumer get?

## There's not an awful lot between them
I'm really torn between the two models. To the point where I'm probably wasting time fussing over which one I'll get, when the difference between them may not make a tangible difference to my work.

Nonetheless, I'm that was inclined. I like buying things of high quality because I thoroughly enjoy the experience they give me, and it gives me a highly disappointing feeling if they don't meet the expectations I had.

With the RS3 vs RS3 Pro, I'm trying to buy a piece of equiptment that:
1. I'll genuinley use over and over again
2. Facilitates my skills growing
3. Grows with me as my skills grow

The last two might seem similar but 2. is about it supporting me to get to the next step in my content craft and 3. is about continuing in the next step of my content craft with me.

## What's the difference?

Here's what the difference is between them as described on [dji.com](https://www.dji.com/uk/products/comparison-rs). The features/benefits you get when you choose the RS3 Pro over the RS3 are:
- **DJI Transmission** - compatilibility with the new beefy transmitter, DJI Transmission (probably only useful if you're making money off this gig and you're a team rather than a solo creator)
- **Larger, heavier payload** - carry a bigger, heavier camera (probably the same as above)
- **Mounting options** - use with vehicle mount, steadicam, slider, cable cam, jib - after research though this seems to speak to more that the RS3 Pro has better remote control capabilities (more on this later)
- **Lidar Autofocus** - works with new lidar focus system (probably for those with manual focus lenses)
- **RSA Port** - which allows you to use an additional control grip, either [remotely using a transmitter](https://smallrig.com/smallrig-wireless-control-sling-handgrip-for-dji-rs-series-3919.html) or wired controllers such as [this on from DJI](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/ronin-tethered-control-handle).

Here are the downsides when you take the RS3 Pro over the RS3, besides price:
- Heavier by 200g (which is tiny tbh)
- It's also bigger in terms of size

Other than that, everything is the exact same. Battery life, stability, Image Transmitter (previously known as RavenEye) compatibility even the new OLED touch screen.

## So how does the prosumer choose?
Well which differences are interesting to us prosumers?

### Not Interesting
**[DJI Transmission](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/dji-transmission-combo?vid=116751)** - probably not. This costs 2x the price of the RS3 Pro alone. You're probably pro if you need this, and if you are you're getting the RS3 Pro.

**Mounting options** - this comes back to the remote control options, because you can mount the RS3 (non-Pro) on vehicle mounts, steadicams, sliders, cable cams, and jibs, it's just that you may not have the level of remote control you desire for the level of mounting. If you're mounting up to a car, you're probably doing a bigger budget project and will be able to pay for the DJI Transmission remote support. But you may get away with the Monitor+ app, or adding the DJI Image Transmitter (assuming that gives better lower latency control than Monitor+)

**Lidar Autofocus** - This accessory alone costs north of £400, so it's a no from me. Maybe one day I'd graduate to this, but from what it seems I think you'd probably want to manually pull focus at the more professional levels anyway.

### Maybe Interesting
**Larger, heavier payload** - maybe? for me, no. I use Sony mirrorless cameras, and my payload is never over 2.5kg, let alone 3kg. That said, this is something that I wouldn't mind having. If I'm flinging around my gimbal quite a bit, it can't hurt to have the extra muscle there in the motors.

### Interesting
**RSA Port** - This has become something that is actually appealing to me. I'll explain based on my hands on with the RS3 (non-Pro) below.

### Summary
So at best there are going to be two things to convince us prosumers to get the Pro over the non-Pro: RSA point for manually controlling the gimbal remotely and more powerful motors that are never going to be phased by our mirrorless camears.

Does't seem like a lot... so what's the cost difference for these benefits, and are these benefits worth that cost?

## What's the cost of the difference?
£280. Straight off the bat, I wouldn't say that £280 (an extra 60%!!) is worth remote hardware control and more powerful motors that we, for the most part, don't need.

**Unless**! You're interested in the Combo packages and/or the Image Transmitter + Phone Holder (why + Phone Holder? later I'll explain why if you're getting the Image Transmitter, it's a no-brainer to get some kind of Phone Holder too. It makes a big difference to the effectiveness of the Image Transmitter). 

The Pro Combo package includes the Image Transmitter and Phone Holder. By comparing the value of the RS3 Combo and the RS3 Pro Combo, you may see more value in the RS3 Pro as the differnce cost between the two becomes significantly lower. 

The standalone RS3 is £469 and the RS3 Combo is £619, making the cost of the combo £150. For £150 you get:
- Carry case
- Brief case handle
- Focus motor

The standalone RS3 Pro is £749 and the RS3 Combo is £949, making the cost of the combo £200. For £200 you get:
- Carry case
- Brief case handle
- Focus motor
- Ronin Image Transmitter (worth £150 standalone)
- Phone Holder (worth £39 standalone)

As you may have worked out, the two extras you get in the RS3 Pro Combo, the Image Transmitter and the Phone Holder, make up for 95% of the Combo price. 

With the RS3, to get the equivalent gear as the RS3 Pro Combo, you'll need to purchase RS3 Combo (£619) with the Image Transmitter (£150) and the Phone Holder (£39) separately. Bringing the total cost to £808. 

With the RS3 Pro Combo costing £949, it brings the difference between the RS3 and RS3 Pro with these bundled items to just £141 (aka half what it was).

So if you're going for the RS3 and want the Image Transmitter and the Phone Holder, you may want to buy the RS3 Pro with the Combo package instead. I'd argue for £141, the difference of remote hardware control and more powerful motors becomes worth it, not to mention that it seems the RS2/RS3 get a lot more interest from 3rd party accessory companies (e.g. SmallRig, Tilta).

## Okay, so sell me the Image Transmitter. What does it do for me?

Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to assume that if you buy the Image Transmitter, you'll buy the Phone Holder. The Image Transmitter's main function is to transmit the image from your camera to your smartphone for remote monitoring. Although with the RS3 Pro you can monitor the Image Transmitter on the OLED screen, it's a bit useless at 1.8" and it's also not always going to be in your face as you move the gimbal around.

Besides remote monitoring, what else does the Image Transmitter give you? Two things: 
1. it allows you to pull focus remotely (you can do this without it using Monitor+, but that has challenging latency and I'm wondering if the Image Transmitter does a better job)
1. it gives you active track (potentially, very handy for solo creators)

Let's talk about these three benefits a bit more.

### Image Monitoring
Like I saw, the main function of the Image Transmitter is to transmit the image from your camera to your smartphone for monitoring.

This could be moot for a lot of us prosumers though... who can either monitor wirelessly using an app or using a small HDMI monitor.

### Pulling Focus
The Image Transmitter connects to your Ronin via USB-C, which means it can either control your camera via the bluetooth connection that the gimbal has with the camera or via the DJI Focus Monitor (if you bought one or got the Combo bundle).

Then on your smartphone, you can pull focus. AFAIK, you can even set A/B points and program the gimbal to pull for you, which is super handy as a solo creator with a limited number of hands.

There'something that's worth mentioning about this feature/benefit: you can pull focus both remotely and on the gimbal directly without the Image Transmitter. The former can be done using an app like Monitor+ and the latter can be done by using the wheel on your gimbal along with either the bluetooth connection from the gimbal to your camera or using a DJI Focus Motor.

So what's the actual benefit in terms of focus pulling with the Image Transmitter I hear you say?

Well if you want to pull focus remotely (e.g. you've programmed your gimbal to make some movements using the Track feature), you may struggle with Monitor+.

The latency when pulling focus with Monitor+ has been pretty bad in my experience, which makes nailing focus quite hard and gives a fluffy feeling to the control.

(I've tried with Sony's app, but it doesn't support focus pulling). 

So my guess here (I don't have an Image Transmitter, but I may get my hands on one in a few days) is that the lower latency of the first party set up with the Image Transmitter may make pulling focus a lot more accurate.

### Active Track
Well for those people, the win you get in still purchasing the Image Transmitter is being able to pull focus remotely without latency. You can pull focus remotely using the Monitor+ app, but there's latency in that app that makes accurate focus pulling quite challenging.

### Pulling Focus Remotely **with** Hardware
The important part here is the combination of _remote_ with _hardware_.

_Can I pull focus on the RS3 (non-Pro) with hardware?_
Yes you can. When you connect the cable to from the gimbal to your camera, you can control focus.

_Can I pull focus on the RS3 (non-Pro) remotely?_
Yes you can, if you download a 3rd party app called Monitor+. However I found latency a bit challenging to getting focus nailed. However, this is something that might be better with the DJI Image Transmitter. But again, if you get the Image Transmitter, then you might want to consider the Pro Combo anyhow as it halves the price gap between the two gimvals for the same gear.

_Can I pull focus with a hardware device when I'm not with (remotely) RS3 (non-Pro)_
With the RS3... no. If you want to do it with hardware you'll either need to use the RSA port on the RS3 Pro to connect a second gimbal handle or you'll have to use the beefy DJI Transmition _and_ the controller to go with that (~£2k).

Some 3rd parties, such as SmallRig, have started creating remotes that work with the RSA port to create a wireless signal to a hardware remote, but their one currently goesn't give you remote focus.

#### In Summary
So in terms of pulling focus remotely with hardware, you're either going to have to spend quite a bit of money to do that or hope that a third party comes out with a way for you to do it. It's worth mentioning that you'll probably want the DJI Image Transmitter too in order to make that remote pulling work.

And that brings me to the second summarising points of this section - remote pulling can't be done with OR without hardware when you have not got a remote monitor either. If you're doing it with software, you either have to use the Monitor+ app (latency) or do it with the DJI Image Transmitter (but I can't speak to the latency of that). Supposing you went for the latter, this could be a reason the get the Pro because of the better bundle value.

The _remote_ part is key because you can actually pull focus on Sony cameras with DJI gimbals without the Image Transmitter. When a device connects to a Sony Alpha camera by cable, it has the ability to send the camera focus pull instructions. However, Sony cameras do not support these instructions being sent via Wi-Fi. 

So for pulling focus remotely you have three options:
- £150 - Get the [DJI Image Transmitter](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/ronin-raveneye-image-transmission-system?from=store-nav) for pulling focus using the DJI smartphone app
- £419 - Get the RS3 Pro and the [DJI Ronin Expansion Base Kit](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/ronin-expansion-base-kit)
- £1,979 - Get the [DJI Transmission](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/dji-transmission-combo?vid=116751) kit

So why would you need to pull focus remotely?

- Cinematic shots where careful control is needed - this is far to hard to do as the gimbal user, you need someone with a dedicated monitor and sole focus on the focus wheel
- Difficult Targetting - if you have a subject that's really hard to keep focus nailed in on and you don't want any errors from the AF system on the camera

### Force Mobile


## Which one am I going for?

Two concerns I have make me want to get the Pro:
1. What if I end up buying DJI Image Transmitter? Then I'm only £141 away from the pro
2. What if I want to mount to a slider, or other accessories? Apparently that's not possible with the non-Pro RS3

One concern stops me from wanting the Pro:
1. What if it's just a bit to big size wise to go on the side of my backback like [I've seen the RS3 carried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKGowtrEvZU) - see below

![](images/ronin-rs3-side-backpack.png)


So if I can cover one concern, perhaps I should get the Pro. I've usually taken the approach of getting a touch more than I need with tech because I hate wishing I'd got another version when I end up not being able to.

- Folded RS3 dimensions: 254×230×68 mm  (L×W×H, excluding camera, grip, and the Extended Grip/Tripod)
- Folded RS3 Pro dimensions: 268×276×68 mm (L×W×H, excluding camera, grip, and the Extended Grip/Tripod)
- Diff: 14mm longer, 46mm wider same height (suppose this is the thickness from the side?)

Longer is not a bigger, just 1.4cm., but the width is substatial - 4.6cm.

I found a [YouTube video by Peter Lindgren](https://youtu.be/bXhnXI-Ka14?t=207) that shows the two gimbals side by side.

![](images/rs3-vs-pro.png)

It's not perfectly easy to see how much of a difference there is, but at least when it comes to how much the tilt axis (the axis/motor that is topmost in the frame) juts out a solid amount more than on the RS3, which could be the 4.6cm we're talking about.

I think to make this decision I need to see both in the flesh, but sadly I can't find anywhere that has both new gimbals in stock with display models for comparisson.

So the best I couild do was go to my local Jessops and see the RSC2 and RS2.

 RS2 | RSC2
---------|----------
![](images/rs2-pd-everyday-20l.jpeg) | ![](images/rsc2-pd-everyday-20l.jpeg)
260×265×70 mm (excluding the BG30 grip) | Folded: 260×210×75 mm (including the handle)

Diff: 0x55x5 mm

So it seems that the diff 

---

Observations:
- Active track could be quite handy when trying to make smooth movements
- Gimbal gets a bit overpowered when rolling with the 85mm lens (820g)
- The dual handle setup makes the gimbal feel a lot lighter
- using the dial/joystick to subtly pan is also handly

Debunked initial myths: <br>
__On the RS3, the only way to control focus remotely was via the DJI Image Transmitter as it connected to the camera via cable__ <br>
**NOPE** - you can do this via the Monitor+ app - it seems that this capability is totally there wirelessly, it's just that Sony's own app does not expose it.
However, the latency on Monitor+ is quite high. I'd hope that the DJI Image Transmission fares better than this. If it doesn't, you'll need to explore another setup for remotely controlling focus. That could be pricy, but as you're controlling focus remotely you're probably a bigger production crew or have lofty goals with bigger budgets.

__You can only power the RS3 Pro with an external battery__
**NOPE** - since the RS3 now has a the same external battery connectivity as the RS3 Pro, you can use external power plates such as [this one from SmallRig](https://www.smallrig.com/smallrig-power-supply-base-plate-for-dji-rs2-3252.html).

__Force Mobile can be used on the RS3 without the Image Transmitter__

## Other Learnings

### 
Callibrating the focus motor on lenses that do not have hard stops.

In this video you can also see that the RS2 has a much more expansive menu for the focus motor, meaning that the auto focus pull feature might only be in the RS2/RS3 Pro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZbzcJhuquM

When that referred to glue, check here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7GlOrmB-Ww

The video also mentioned 3D printing camera stops.

The learning here is that the Focus Motor knows where the end is by the motor not being able to physically turn anymore. Since the Focus Ring on Sony lenses does not have an end (it's electronic) it will keep going and eventually start skipping on the clamp. You have to send the end points manually, on other words.

I'm still not able to find the auto-focus pull on the RS3.

RS3 Pro only software features: 
- multiple saved modes (profiles)
  - including for lenses on the focus motors
- Auto focus pull settings
- Focus motor chaining?
