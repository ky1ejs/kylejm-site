I'm really town between which Ronin Gimbal to get.

Here's what the difference is between them:

The features/benefits you get when you choose the RS3 Pro over the RS3 are:
- Works with the beefy transmitter, DJI Transmission (probably only useful if you're making money off this gig)
- Carry a bigger, heavier camera (probably the same as above)
- Use with vehicle mount, steadicam, slider, cable cam, jib
- Works with new lidar focus system (probably for those with manual focus lenses)
- RSA port (which allows you to use an additional control grip) and charing adatpter port (port powering the gimbal off a source other than the battery)


The downsides you get when you take the RS3 Pro over the RS3 are:
- Heavier by 200g (which is tiny tbh)

Other than that, everything is the exact same. Battery life, stability, Image Transmitter (previously known as RavenEye) compatibility even the new OLED screen.

There is something that might be of interesting to consider when it comes to making your choice, particularly if you're going to splash out on the Combo option. 

The standalone RS3 is £469 and the RS3 Combo is £619, making the cost of the combo £150. For that you get:
- Carry case
- Brief case handle
- Focus motor

The standalone RS3 Pro is £749 and the RS3 Combo is £949, making the cost of the combo £200. For that you get:
- Carry case
- Brief case handle
- Focus motor
- Ronin Image Transmitter (worth £150 standalone)
- Phone Holder (worth £39 standdalone)

As you've probably worked out, the two extras you get in the RS3 Pro Combo, the Image Transmitter and the Phone Holder, make up for 95% of the Combo price. 

If you buy the RS3 Combo and add these two things, you'll pay £808. This makes it only £141 more to get the Pro Combo, where as the difference between the standlone models is £280, saving you £139.

So if you're going for the RS3 and want the phone holder and Image Transmitter, you may want to buy the RS3 Pro with the Combo package instead.

## So what does the Ronin Image Transmitter do for me?

Three things: 1) it transmits a feed camera feed to a smarthphone over wifi, 2) it allows you to pull focus remotely, and 3) it allows you to use Force Mobile mode.

### Transmitting Camera Feed
Some of you, like me, might say that they don't need that since their Sony Alpha camera can transmit a live feed to their iPhone over Wi-Fi. 

Well for those people, the win you get is being able to pull focus remotely (if you have the DJI Focus Motor), the key word here being _remotely_; we'll come back to that. The Image Transmitter connects via cable to both the camera and the gimbal, meaning that it can communicate with the Focus Motor.

### Pulling Focus Remotely
The _remote_ part is key because you can actually pull focus on Sony cameras with DJI gimbals without the Image Transmitter. When a device connects to a Sony Alpha camera by cable, it has the ability to send the camera focus pull instructions. However, Sony cameras do not support these instructions being sent via Wi-Fi. 

So for pulling focus remotely you have three options:
- £150 - Get the [DJI Image Transmitter](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/ronin-raveneye-image-transmission-system?from=store-nav) for pulling focus using the DJI smartphone app
- £419 - Get the RS3 Pro and the [DJI Ronin Expansion Base Kit](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/ronin-expansion-base-kit)
- £1,979 - Get the [DJI Transmission](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/dji-transmission-combo?vid=116751) kit

So why would you need to pull focus remotely?

- Cinematic shots where careful control is needed - this is far to hard to do as the gimbal user, you need someone with a dedicated monitor and sole focus on the focus wheel
- Difficult Targetting - if you have a subject that's really hard to keep focus nailed in on and you don't want any errors from the AF system on the camera

### Force Mobile


## Which one am I going for?

Two concerns I have make me want to get the Pro:
1. What if I end up buying DJI Image Transmitter? Then I'm only £141 away from the pro
2. What if I want to mount to a slider, or other accessories? Apparently that's not possible with the non-Pro RS3

One concern stops me from wanting the Pro:
1. What if it's just a bit to big size wise to go on the side of my backback like [I've seen the RS3 carried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKGowtrEvZU) - see below

So if I can cover one concern, perhaps I should get the Pro. I've usually taken the approach of getting a touch more than I need with tech because I hate wishing I'd got another version when I end up not being able to.

- Folded RS3 dimensions: 254×230×68 mm  (L×W×H, excluding camera, grip, and the Extended Grip/Tripod)
- Folded RS3 Pro dimensions: 268×276×68 mm (L×W×H, excluding camera, grip, and the Extended Grip/Tripod)
- Diff: 14mm longer, 46mm wider same height (suppose this is the thickness from the side?)

Longer is not a bigger, just 1.4cm., but the width is substatial - 4.6cm.

I think to make this decision I need to see both in the flesh.
