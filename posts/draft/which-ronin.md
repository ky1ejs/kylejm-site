# DJI RS3 vs RS3 Pro - which one should a prosumer get?

## There's not an awful lot between them
I'm really torn between the two models. To the point where I'm probably wasting time fussing over which one I'll get, when the difference between them may not make a tangible difference to my work.

Nonetheless, I'm that way inclined. I like buying things of high quality because I thoroughly enjoy the experience they give me, and it gives me a highly disappointing feeling if they don't meet my expectations.

With the RS3 vs RS3 Pro, I'm trying to buy a piece of equiptment that:
1. I'll genuinley use over and over again
2. Facilitates growth of my videography/cinematography skills
3. Grows with me as my skills grow

The last two might seem similar but 2. is about the gimbal supporting me to get to the next step in my content craft and 3. is about continuing in the next step of my content craft with me. In otherwords, I don't want to outgrow it anytime soon, wishing to use a more advanced feature for which it cannot support.

## What's the difference?

### RS3 Pro - The Good (what it has on top of the RS3 non-Pro)
Here's what the difference is between them as described on [dji.com](https://www.dji.com/uk/products/comparison-rs). The features/benefits you get when you choose the RS3 Pro over the RS3 are:
- **[DJI Transmission](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/dji-transmission-combo?vid=116751)** - compatilibility with the new beefy transmitter, DJI Transmission (probably only useful if you're making money off this gig and you're a team rather than a solo creator)
- **Larger, heavier payload** - carry a bigger, heavier camera (probably the same as above)
- **Mounting options** - _"use with vehicle mount, steadicam, slider, cable cam, jib"_ - this is how it's described on DJI's site but it's not strictly true, and is perhaps a bit misleading. The RS3 and RS3 pro have the same battery connector/mechanism as each other, which was not the case on RS2/RSC2. This means that you can mount both gimbals on the aformentioned accessories, as well as power them without a battery via the extension kit. The real difference between the two is that you cannot remotely control the RS3 as it has no RSA Port (the funny port that's positioned at one of the NATO rail attachment points).
- **Lidar Autofocus** - works with new lidar focus system (probably for those with manual focus lenses)
- **RSA Port** - allows you to use an additional control grip, either [remotely using a transmitter](https://smallrig.com/qsmallrig-wireless-control-sling-handgrip-for-dji-rs-series-3919.html) or wired controllers such as [this on from DJI](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/ronin-tethered-control-handle).

There's also at least one software thing, maybe two, that only the RS3 Pro has
- Multiple saved configurations (profiles) - you can save and recall settings on the gimbal. Useful for either different camera setups,  different operators or different scenes.
- (TBC!) Dolly Zoom - this feature allows you to configure the gimbal to pull focus for you. You set an start point, end point and a duration, and then trigger the gimbal to pull while you manage the movement. Super cool for solo creators. This feature was on the RS2 and while I've had the RS3 I've been unable to find it or any mention on the internet that it's on the RS3. When I get the RS3 Pro, I'll be able to confirm.

### RS3 Pro - The Bad
Here are the downsides when you take the RS3 Pro over the RS3, besides price:
- Heavier by 200g (which is tiny tbh)
- It's also bigger in terms of size

Other than that, everything is the exact same. Battery life, stability, Image Transmitter (previously known as RavenEye) compatibility, and even the new OLED touch screen.

## So how does the prosumer choose?
Well which differences are interesting to us prosumers? What's the price/value difference? Which additional features would motivate us to part with more cash and deal with a heavier, larger gimbal.

### Not Interesting
**[DJI Transmission](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/dji-transmission-combo?vid=116751)** - if you're interested in one of these you're highly likely to be a professional, not a prosumer. You'll know if you want/need any of these, and if you don't, you probably don't need it. It costs 2x the price of the RS3 Pro alone. You're probably pro if you need this, and if you are you're getting the RS3 Pro.

**Mounting options**
As mentioned above, the real difference here is the remote control. The RS3 does have remote control, it's just that you may not have the level/fidelity of remote control you desire. With the RS3 your remote control options are software only via the DJI Image Transmitter. Or you can remote control your camera directly using its own mobile app (or a 3rd party app such as Monitor+), but this will obviously only give you control of camera settings and focus, not the gimbal movement. 

So the question here is actually remote control, not mounting options. Remote control could be interesting for us, we'll touch on that shortly.

**Lidar Autofocus** - This accessory alone costs north of £400, so it's a no from me. Maybe one day I'd graduate to this, but from what it seems I think you'd probably want to manually pull focus at the more professional levels anyway. Although this Lidar tech is so cool to see in action (especially the depth map you get on screen), it still causes "AI" looking results (aka, not smooth or completely convincing), at least in the examples I've seen.

### Maybe Interesting
**Larger, heavier payload** - maybe? At first I thought: for me, no. I use Sony mirrorless cameras, and my payload is never over 2.5kg, let alone 3kg. But I managed to get my hands on an RS3 lately, and I noticed that when paired with my 85mm lens (~840g) the gimbal really struggled with rolling, sometimes even doing that gimbal collapse thing that gimbals do, looking like a toddler falling over. So if I had the extra motor muscle, I wouldn't be unhappy lets say.

### Interesting
**RSA Port** - This has become something that is actually appealing to me. I'll explain based on my hands on with the RS3 (non-Pro) below.

### Summary
So at best there are going to be two things to convince us prosumers to get the RS3 Pro over the RS3: 
1. RSA point for manually controlling the gimbal remotely 
1. More powerful motors that are never going to be phased by our mirrorless camears.

Does't seem like a lot... so what's the cost difference for these benefits, and are these benefits worth that cost?

## What's the cost of the difference?
£280. Straight off the bat, I wouldn't say that £280 (an extra 60% on top of what the RS3 costs!!) is worth remote hardware control and more powerful motors that we, for the most part, don't need.

**Unless**! You're interested in the Combo packages and/or the Image Transmitter + Phone Holder (why + Phone Holder? later I'll explain why if you're getting the Image Transmitter, it's a no-brainer to get some kind of Phone Holder too. It makes a big difference to the effectiveness of the Image Transmitter). 

Okay bare with me, let me explain. By comparing the value of the RS3 Combo and the RS3 Pro Combo, you may see more value in the RS3 Pro as the differnce in cost between the two becomes significantly lower. 

The standalone RS3 is £469 and the RS3 Combo is £619, making the cost of the combo £150. For £150 you get:
- Carry case
- Brief case handle
- Focus motor

The standalone RS3 Pro is £749 and the RS3 Combo is £949, making the cost of the combo £200. For £200 you get:
- Carry case
- Brief case handle
- Focus motor
- Ronin Image Transmitter (worth £150 standalone)
- Phone Holder (worth £39 standalone)

As you may have worked out, the two extras you get in the RS3 Pro Combo, the Image Transmitter and the Phone Holder, make up for 95% of the Combo price. 

So lets say you are interested in getting the Image Transmitter and Phone Holder. With the RS3, to get the equivalent gear as the RS3 Pro Combo, you'll need to purchase RS3 Combo (£619) with the Image Transmitter (£150) and the Phone Holder (£39) separately. Bringing the total cost to £808. 

With the RS3 Pro Combo costing £949, this brings the difference between the RS3 and RS3 Pro with these bundled items to just £141 (aka half what it was).

So if you're going for the RS3 and want the Image Transmitter and the Phone Holder, you may want to buy the RS3 Pro with the Combo package instead. I'd argue for £141, the difference of remote hardware control and more powerful motors becomes worth it, not to mention that it seems the RS2/RS3 get a lot more interest from 3rd party accessory companies (e.g. SmallRig, Tilta).

## Okay, so sell me the Image Transmitter. What does it do for me?
Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to assume that if you buy the Image Transmitter, you'll buy the Phone Holder. The Image Transmitter's main function is to transmit the image from your camera to your smartphone for remote monitoring. Although with the RS3 Pro you can monitor the Image Transmitter on the OLED screen, it's a bit useless at 1.8" and it's also not always going to be in your face as you move the gimbal around.

Besides remote monitoring, what else does the Image Transmitter give you? Two things: 
1. it allows you to pull focus remotely (you can do this without it using Monitor+, but that has challenging latency and I'm wondering if the Image Transmitter does a better job - I'll be able to speak to this when I get my hands on an RS3 Pro soon)
1. it gives you active track (potentially, very handy for solo creators, and is the thing that convinces me to get the Image Transmitter, and therefore the RS3 Pro)

Let's talk about these three benefits a bit more.

### Image Monitoring
Like I said, the main function of the Image Transmitter is to transmit the image from your camera to your smartphone for monitoring.

This could be moot for a lot of us prosumers though... who can either monitor wirelessly using an app or using a small HDMI monitor.

### Pulling Focus (Remotely)
_note: you may need to additionally purchase the DJI Focus Motor for this feautre to work. I can confirm this when I receive an RS3 Pro in the next few weeks._

The Image Transmitter connects to your Ronin via USB-C, which means it can either control your camera's focus via the cable going from the gimbal to your camera, or if you've got a DJI Focus Motor you can control focus via this.

There'something that's worth mentioning about this feature/benefit: you can pull focus both remotely and on the gimbal directly without the Image Transmitter. The former can be done using an app like Monitor+ and the latter can be done by using the wheel at the front of your gimbal along with either the bluetooth connection from the gimbal to your camera or using a DJI Focus Motor (_disclaimer: I was not able to control focus via Bluetooth on my Sony A7IV, despite DJI's site saying this is possible_).

So if you can pull focus remotely without the Image Transmitter, why is this a benefit? On my Sony A7IV, the only option to pull focus remotely via an app and no additional hardware is using Monitor+ (I've tried with Sony's app, but it doesn't support focus pulling). The latency when pulling focus with Monitor+ has been pretty bad in my experience, which makes nailing focus quite hard and gives a fluffy feeling to the control. So my guess here (I don't have an Image Transmitter, but I will have it in a week or so and then I can confirm) is that the lower latency of the first party set up with the Image Transmitter may make pulling focus a lot more accurate.

### Active Track
This is it. This is the feature that tipped the balance and pushed me to get the RS3 Pro over the RS3. If you've used a DJI drone before, you'll be familiar with their Active Track technology that they've had for quite a long time now.

Image Tranmsmitter will use the HDMI feed it gets from your camera to track a subject of your choice, moving the gimbal to keep it in frame. This essentially takes some cognitive load off your brain, making it easier to move around with the gimbal without having to be surgical about keeping the framing right. 

For me, I don't expect to use Active Track to do all of the framing, but I do expect it to assist me really well. Imagine I'm running along side the subject: I expect the micro movements to handled by the gimbal while I take care of the macro ones.

## The Answer! Which one am I choosing?
If you've been reading this post word for word, you'll have noticed that I've said a few times that I'll be getting the RS3 Pro Combo. Here's a quick summary of why.

Main Reasons:
- **Active Track** will help keep subject in frame while my mind is parallelising focus, physically moving, directing, watching out for obstacles etc.
- **The extra muscle** in the motors that will help deal with my heavy f1.4 85mm Sony lens (this compresssed focal length will help my footage stand out from others because of its unique look)

Other Reasons:
- **Remote hardware controls** - I can add a tethered or wireless handle to allow me to control the gimbal remotely with hardware. This is exciting to me because while I've had the RS3 to try out I've loved using the Dual Handles, but using them means you can't control the gimbal joystick or wheel. Having a tethered (or wirelss) handle will allow me to add controls to one of the dual handles. I've wrote quite a bit about this in the _Pulling Focus_ section below.

Prior to making this decision I had two primary concerns that were pusing me towards getting the Pro:
1. What if I end up buying DJI Image Transmitter? Then I'm only £141 away from the pro, which I'd happily pay
1. What if I want to mount to a slider, or other accessories? Apparently that's not possible with the non-Pro RS3

In the end I nullified the second point by learning that the RS3 can work with these accessories, despite being limited to software wireless control and not hardware.

The first point however is implicitly what made push become shove, because I do want the Image Transmitter for Active Track, which I only realised after playing with the RS3 and trying to keep a subject in frame, realising that it's a little tricky at times. 

On the other hand, prior to making this decision I had one concern that was stopping me from buying the Pro:
1. What if it's just a bit to big size wise to go on the side of my backback like [I've seen the RS3 carried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKGowtrEvZU) - see below
![](images/ronin-rs3-side-backpack.png)

I still don't really know the answer to this... But I will in a few weeks. I'm hoping that it's doable. And if it's not, I'll able to put the gimbal head in the top of my Peak Design backpack.

## I got my hands on the RS3 and leant a thing or two
While I was dilberating over which gimbal to get, I just went ahead and ordered one. At the time, the shipping estimates were just going up and up, so I thought it's better to make the wrong mistake and get one rather than make the right mistake and wait ages to get one, particularly as DJI's return policy allows you to open and use their products before returning them.

While I've had it I've learnt a thing or two. Some things are clarifications, some are corrections, some were completely new learnings.

### Pulling Focus
How can you pull focus with a DJI Ronin RS3:
- Using the wheel at the front of the gimbal via a bluetooth connection to your camera (on some cameras, didn't work on my Sony A7IV despite DJI claiming that it does)
- Using the wheel at the front of the gimbal via a cable from the gimbal to your camera
- Using the wheel at the front of the gimbal via the DJI Focus Motor (the way to go if the above two don't work for you)

Notice these all require you to use the wheel at the front of the gimbal. What if your hands aren't on the center grip. e.g.: 
- you're in briefcase mode
- you're using the dual handles
- you've got someone else pulling focus
- your gimbal is mounted to a jib, steadicam, slider or maybe even on a vehicle

In these cases you'll need to control focus without using the gimbal's wheel.

To do this you have a few options, all of which can be done by the RS3 Pro but only some of which can be done by the RS3. This is due to the RS3 Pro having an RSA port, which allows you to connect to the gimbal and control it. Essentially you are able to cable a replica of the grip on your gimbal. There are also some 3rd party accessories that allow you to make use a wireless replica of your gimbal's grip, by attaching a transmitter to the RSA port.

here are the options:
- DJI Image Transmitter (RS3 / RS3 Pro)
- DJI Ronin app + DJI Focus Motor (RS3 / RS3 Pro)
- Your camera's smartphone app (not all cameras support focus pulling via their app - looking at you, Sony) (RS3 / RS3 Pro)
- Using 3rd Party apps such as Monitor+ (note that the latency on 3rd party apps might make this difficult for you to use, depending if you're pulling in real time or just setting up a static shot perhaps) (RS3 / RS3 Pro)
- DJI Transmission (RS3 Pro only)
- DJI Tethered Control (RS3 Pro only)
- 3rd party tethered control (Tilta offer a wireless one, as do SmallRig, but the latter doesn't have the front wheel) (RS3 Pro only)

You might notice that the difference between the RS3 and RS3 Pro in this the vein of focus pulling is that RS3 Pro offers you hardware options for remote focus pulling, where as with RS3 only offers software.

So could you dangle the RS3 of the back of a car and pull focus remotely? Yes! Using an Image Transmitter.

I'm guessing that DJI don't really market that use case for the RS3 though since if you're running that level of set up you're probably doing a much bigger production that can affort the RS3 Pro and the DJI Transmission. And you probably have a heavier cinema level camera that will need the beefier RS3 Pro motors.

Also notice that all of the hardware options are pretty darn expensive, aside from the SmallRig one but as mentioned this does not allow you to focus anyhow because it doesn't have a wheel: 
- £1,979 [DJI Transmission](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/dji-transmission-combo)
- £309 [DJI Tethered Control](https://store.dji.com/uk/product/ronin-tethered-control-handle)
- £576 [Tilta TGA-RCK Wireless Remote](https://www.cinegearpro.co.uk/products/tilta-tga-rck-wireless-remote-control-kit-for-dji-rs-2) (note that you can't use Dual Handles on the RS3 with this one as it takes up one of the Nato Ports)
- £102 [SmallRig Wireless Remote](https://www.smallrig.com/smallrig-wireless-control-handgrip-for-dji-rs-series-3949.html) (no focus wheel)

It seems quite hard to find a remote grip that also has the focus wheel - notice that neither the Tilta or SmallRig do, although you can attach second control to the Tilta handle that does have a focus wheel only (or is literally a focus wheel). I started to realise that this is probably because on more professional setups the wheel on the handle is quite small, innaccurate and can't pull for long enough; once you've pulled for a fingers length, you need to lift your finger off and reposition it back on the wheel to keep pulling.

So why would you need to pull focus remotely?

Here are a couple of use cases I came up with:
- Cinematic shots where careful control is needed - this is far too hard to do as the gimbal user, you need someone with a dedicated monitor and sole focus on the focus wheel
- Difficult Targetting - if you have a subject that's really hard to keep focus nailed in on with an autofocus system 

Not got either of these use cases? Perhaps you don't need to care about remote pulling.

So in summary, when it comes to pulling focus remotely with hardware, you're either going to have to spend quite a bit of money or hope that a third party comes out with a cheap wireless product with a wheel (e.g. SmallRig added a wheel to their existing product). It's worth mentioning that you'll probably want some wireless transmiter, such as the DJI Image Transmitter, in order to make that remote pulling work. How can you pull focus remotely without an image?

### Size comparison of the RS3 and RS3 Pro

- Folded RS3 dimensions: 254×230×68 mm  (L×W×H, excluding camera, grip, and the Extended Grip/Tripod)
- Folded RS3 Pro dimensions: 268×276×68 mm (L×W×H, excluding camera, grip, and the Extended Grip/Tripod)
- **Difference**: The Pro is 14mm longer, 46mm wider and the same height (I suppose the height is the thickness from the side?)

I think that "longer" is neglagible, it's just 1.4cm, but the width is substatial at 4.6cm.

As mentioned a few times, when I get the RS3 Pro in a few weeks I'll be able to properlly speak to the feel of the difference in size between the two gimbals. If they'd have been in store for launch, I'd of been able to judge this more quickly. Alas they were not, only the RS2 and RSC2 were. I did go and compare those, read on.

Until then, I found a [YouTube video by Peter Lindgren](https://youtu.be/bXhnXI-Ka14?t=207) that shows the two gimbals side by side.

![](images/rs3-vs-pro.png)

It's not perfectly easy to see how much of a difference there is, but at least when it comes to how much the tilt axis (the axis/motor that is topmost in the frame) juts out a solid amount more than on the RS3, which could be the 4.6cm we're talking about.

Until I got my hands on the RS3 and RS3 Pro, the best I couild do was go to my local Jessops and see the RSC2 and RS2.

 RS2 | RSC2
---------|----------
![](images/rs2-pd-everyday-20l.jpeg) | ![](images/rsc2-pd-everyday-20l.jpeg)

Here are the measurements from the specs on DJI's site:
- RS2: "_260×265×70 mm (excluding the BG30 grip)_"
- RSC2: "_260×210×75 mm (including the handle)_"

It's hugely annoying to me that one of these includes the handle/grip and one doesn't. And considering that the difference between this two is mainly in middle dimension, at 5.5cm, and the handle has got to be at least that length... is this a mistake on their end?

Either way, this wasn't enough for me to compare the RS3 Pro and RS3. It seems that the RS3 has gotten slightly smaller than the RSC2 and the RS3 has gotten bigger than the RS2 to carry that bigger payload.

As you can see from the photo of the RS2 (although it has got the base handle on which I couldn't unscrew), it's already looking pretty big! So maybe I'll be forced to put the RS3 Pro inside my bag after all.

### Some observations while using the RS3

- Active Track seems like it would be really useful when trying to make smooth movements. The joystick will take some getting used to, I'm sure the Image Transmitter + Active Track could do a better job than me with less effort/stress on my end
- Gimbal gets a bit overpowered when rolling with the 85mm lens (820g)
- The dual handle setup makes the gimbal feel a lot lighter and is super comfy, although with this setup you lose access to the joystick/wheel control (on the RS3 Pro you can add an auxilary handle (either 3rd party or from DJI) to keep these controls while using dual handle mode
- Using the dial/joystick to subtly pan is very pleasing


### Debunked myths (or invalidated initial assumptions)
__On the RS3, the only way to control focus remotely was via the DJI Image Transmitter as it connected to the camera via cable__ <br>
**NOPE** - you can do this via the Monitor+ app - it seems that this capability is totally there wirelessly, it's just that Sony's own app does not expose it.
However, the latency on Monitor+ is quite high. I'd hope that the DJI Image Transmission fares better than this. If it doesn't, you'll need to explore another setup for remotely controlling focus. That could be pricy, but as you're controlling focus remotely you're probably a bigger production crew or have lofty goals with bigger budgets.

__You can only power the RS3 Pro with an external battery__
**NOPE** - since the RS3 now has a the same external battery connectivity as the RS3 Pro, you can use external power plates such as [this one from SmallRig](https://www.smallrig.com/smallrig-power-supply-base-plate-for-dji-rs2-3252.html).

### Force Mobile works out of the box on all models
When I wrote the first draft of this post I stated a benefit of having the DJI Image Transmitter was the ability to use Force Mobile. 

**Not true!** You can use Force Mobile simply by connecting your smartphone to your gimbal (either RS3 or RS3 Pro) using the Ronin app.

## Other Learnings

### Be careful when using the Focus Motor with lenses that do not have hard stops
I tried auto-callibrating my Focus Motor with my Sony lenses. No where has it been mentioned in any video or piece of content that I've seen that the way that the Focus Motor auto-callibrates is by hitting some resisitance on your lens. Some lenses, especially cinema lenses, focus mechanically. Where as lenses for popular mirrorless camears tend to focus by wire, meaning that the focus ring can turn infinitly as it's not connected mechanically to the glass.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZbzcJhuquM) offers a technique for setting up hard stops on focus-by-wire lenses. There's also talk of using glue or 3D printed hard stops! (might be worth a google for printing hard stops)

I found a bit more about the aformetioned glueing the focus ring (sounds a bit nuts to me) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7GlOrmB-Ww). 

More talk about "_focus-by-wire_" focus on lenses not being able to auto-callibrate with the Focus Motor on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/Bg-owcqxl9Q?t=259).

### Using Dolly Zoom
You might have seen mention on YouTube and other places about the Dolly Zoom feature on RS2. 

This feature allows you to start a focus start point, end point and a duration. When you initiate the Dolly Zoom, the gimbal will pull focus for you from the start point to the finish point automatically, leaving you to focus on the gimbal movement. This is amazing for solo creators who want professional results with their camera but only have a limited number of hands.

I love the sound of this feature, but I've been unable to find it on the RS3, or any mention on the internet that the RS3 has it.

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA8FzKvoZ58) you can also see that the RS2 has a much more expansive menu for the focus motor, potentially meaning that the Dolly Zoom feature might only be on the RS2/RS3 Pro. It would be stange to me that DJI made this awesome feature on the RS2 and did not keep it in the new models of Ronin gimbals.

When I get my RS3 Pro in a few weeks I can confirm this.


## Open Questions I still have
- How big does the RS3 Pro feel vs the RS3
- How good is Active Track for helping you with framing
- Is the latency on the DJI Image Transmitter enough low enough to pull focus with accuracy
- Can you chain the Focus Motors (the new "2022" ones have two USB-C ports) or is this to chain something else?
