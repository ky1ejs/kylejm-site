## Moza Slypod Pro
The Moza Slypod Pro is the most appealing concept due to it's monopod design. When it pushes out you have no need to try hit the rails of usually automated sliders. It can also push through tight gaps and mounting it to a tripod seems more trivial that chunky track sliders.

However the execution of the concept is terrible, particularly when it comes to the app. Every single YouTube video I've seen either spoke to this, or seemed to choose to not mention any cons about the Slypod at all, perhaps for sponsorship reasons (I know that's a speculative thought, but the people who hate it really hate it so I'm surprised for the other videos to not mention a single con.)

## YC Onion
YC Onion products attempt to work with other gimbals using their app to connect to multiple devices at once:

Doesn't seem perfect, but might be usable. From that video it seems a bit too finicky for me to try use.

## Edelkrone vs Rhino

Rhino seems the way to go for both functionality and price


## Use your gimbal? How can you make that nice and smooth?
